A = B ↔ ∀ x : X, x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B

To prove that two sets are equal, one needs to use the axiom
of extensionality: two sets are equal if and only if they have
the same elements.

In Lean's maths library this axiom is called `ext_iff`.

```
lemma ext_iff : A = B ↔ ∀ x : X, x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B
```

/- Hint: A word on coding style

After a `split` statement, one goal turns into two. A good programming style
would be to use `{}` brackets to work on each goal individually, like this:
```
begin
  split,
  { insert,
    proof of,
    first goal
  },
  { insert,
    proof of,
    second goal
  }
end
```

This way you only ever have one goal to work on, and your code becomes
easier to read. After `split` you might want to write 
```
{ sorry},
{ sorry}
```
so that your code has no errors while you're working on it.

/- Hint : Stuck?
To prove the theorem below, remember that you can use `split` to 
change the goal into two goals, corresponding to the left-right and
right-left implication, respectively. For the first goal, after
`intro h,` the equality of the two sets can be manipulated
using `rw ext_iff`.
-/

/- Hint: rewrite failures and the `simp_rw` tactic
`rw` doesn't work "under a binder". In other words, if your goal is
`⊢	∀ (x : X), x ∈ B ↔ x ∈ A ∪ B` then `rw mem_union_iff` won't work!
It's the `∀` which is blocking it. Either do `intro x` (and then
the `rw` will work), or use a more powerful rewrite tactic
called `simp_rw`, which will work

/- Lemma
If $A$ and $B$ are sets of any type $X$, then
$$ A \subseteq B \iff A \cup B = B.$$
