# The Max minigame

## By Kevin Buzzard, Dan Stanescu and Gavin Thomson

# What is this game?

It's just a test of the max levels of the forthcoming real number game. 

This game is a sequel to
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" target="blank">the natural number game</a>.
The levels in the Max minigame need to be solved using tactics. To learn how to use these tactics, I would
recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "Advanced Proposition world". I will
not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural number game here.

# Thanks

Many thanks to Mohammad Pedramfar, without whom this game would not exist.
